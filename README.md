# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

This simple study guide webpage was an initial foray into the world of web development. It serves as my introduction to devloping and publishing HTML, CSS, and JavaSCript code prior to my start in the UCSD Coding Bootcamp. As I have progressed through the lessons I've moved from a simple HTML only webpage to one that, while still simple, has allowed me to being to understand how code affects the finished product. During this project I have learned how to work within VS Code, navigate GitHub and GitBash, and ensure that I'm working in the proper branches.

It is my intention to build upon what I've learned here and continue to iterate and improve the look and functionality of this webpage through self-directed study, as well as through assignments given throughout the course of the upcoming coding bootcamp.
